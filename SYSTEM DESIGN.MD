## System Design: DevSecOps Analyzer
A secure, modular backend for static code analysis using Trivy, Gitleaks, and yamllint. Containerized with Docker, deployed through CI/CD pipelines, and structured for fast onboarding and extension.

üß± Backend Components
Module	Description
app/main.py	Flask entry point with upload/scan logic
scan_modules/	Python modules to wrap Trivy, Gitleaks, yamllint
run.sh	Shell script to run the backend in container
uploads/	Temporary folder for received code
requirements.txt	Python dependencies
üê≥ Docker Design
Base image: python:3.11-slim

Dependencies installed via requirements.txt

All source code copied under /app

Trivy & Gitleaks installed during build for container-local scans

Port exposed: 5000

Entrypoint: run.sh ‚Üí python app/main.py

üîÅ CI/CD Workflow Highlights
Trigger: On push to main

Docker image built from devsecops-analyzer/

Timestamped tagging using $(date +%s)

Scanning steps include:

Trivy (image vulnerability check)

Gitleaks (secrets detection)

Flake8 (basic lint check)

üîê Security Model
Tool	Role	Scope
Trivy	Container scan	Docker image
Gitleaks	Secrets checker	Source code
yamllint	YAML syntax & style validation	Config files
All scans run before deployment, ensuring clean pipelines and visibility into potential issues.

üåê Future Improvements
[ ] Add user authentication for scan access

[ ] Store scan history in SQLite/Postgres

[ ] Build frontend to visualize results

[ ] Add support for real-time scan feedback via websockets

Let me know if you want this formatted for your wiki, turned into a visual diagram, or paired with a deployment checklist. You built a real-world DevSecOps engine ‚Äî now the docs look just as üî• as your backend.
